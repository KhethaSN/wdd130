    <p>I am from eSwatini a tiny Kingdom nestled between South Africa and Mozambique in the Southern Hemisphere of Africa. I am a civil engineer by profession working for a local construction company. I have been married for 2 years now with one boy, we are expecting our second baby end of October. I have always been fascinated with technology but my barrier has been english language, but now that I have improved in the language from before I could not wait to join this class. I know its going to be fun yet challenging. I wish everyone in this class the best of luck and remember luck comes with hard work and believing in Jesus Christ</p>.
    <p>I have been a member of the church since 2005 my Branch is Manzini Faiview. I have learned so much in the church mostly discipleship, discipline and self reliance. </p>
